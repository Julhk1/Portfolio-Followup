# Portfolio-Followup

This dashboard is connected directly to a Google Sheets file that automatically updates with the latest stock values, making it a real-time monitoring tool for portfolio management.

Here are some key features of the dashboard:
✅ Purchase Value vs Current Value: A quick glance at the portfolio’s growth.
✅ ROI Percentage: Clear visualization of return on investment.
✅ Portfolio Composition: Breakdown of investments by company.
✅ Gains and Losses by Stock: Analysis of individual stock performance.
✅ Real-Time Updates: Thanks to the Google Sheets integration, all data stays fresh and up-to-date.

Through this project, I combined data visualization, automation, and investment analysis to create an efficient tool for tracking stock performance.
